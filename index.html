      Association football, commonly known as football, or soccer,[a] is a team
      sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their
      feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The
      objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by
      moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal
      defended by the opposing team.
